            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For although it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God ſometimes, for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Church, to giue vnto it as it were
<hi>Halcyon</hi> daies: yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it is not, that it ſhould any long time continue in reſt and pleaſure. Nay, by the word of GOD wee
<pb facs="tcp:18666:3"/>know, &amp; by experience ſometimes of our ſelues (her Maieſties royall perſon not excepted) and now of our neighbours round about vs we ſee, that the Church of God in this world, as it euer hath bin, ſo muſt it euer be vnder the croſſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee will bee compted of the Church indeede, and glorie in that excellent name of a Chriſtian, let vs knowe aſſuredlie, that vnto vs, euen vnto vs (that haue ſo long liued in reſt and pleaſure, if wee be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God) in ſome ſort and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a triall muſt come. For, if God chaſtiſe euerie ſonne whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth, and euery member of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body muſt be faſhioned like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, if the afflictions of this world are manifeſt tokens to the children of God, of his fauour and loue towards them, and ſure pledges of their adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how can we looke, or how can we deſire to bee exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:18666:3"/>from this common condition of God his owne children and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold? To this end therefore (right Honorable Ladie) I haue tranſlated this little booke, firſt to admoniſh ſome (who for lacke of experience, neuer feeling other daies than theſe full of peace and quietnes) that they learne to applie vnto themſelues whatſoeuer they heare or reade of the triall of GOD his children, leaſt falſelie imagining it to appertaine either to the times that are paſt, or to other Nations, it fall ſodainlie vpon them as a theefe in the night, &amp; they be deſtitute of all hope and comfort. Secondlie, to awake others aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both in knowledge and other graces, whom notwithſtanding, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan (by the deceaueable luſts &amp; vaine pleaſures of this wicked world) hath ſo rockt a ſleepe, that they ſeeme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as they that are diſeaſed with the Lethargie, to haue forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both
<pb facs="tcp:18666:4"/>themſelues, their holie calling and profeſsion. Laſt of all, to comfort an other ſort, whome it hath pleaſed GOD ſo to preſſe downe with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and to exerciſe with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall afflictions and calamities of this mortall life, as no times ſeeming fauourable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they can ſcarſe receiue the words of any comfort. And becauſe your Honor hath been of long time, not onlie a profeſſour, but alſo a louer of the trueth, whom the Lord (exalting to an higher place of dignitie than many other) hath ſet vp, as it were a light vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an high candleſticke, to giue light vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, I haue eſpeciallie dedicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Honour this my poore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, humblie beſeeching the Lord to make it no leſſe comfortable to your Honour, and to thoſe that ſhall reade it, than it hath been vnto me who haue tranſlated it. Euerie one in his calling is bound to doo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:18666:4"/>to the furtherance of the holie building; but becauſe great things by reaſon of my ſex, I may not doo, and that which I may, I ought to doo, I haue according to my duetie, brought my poore basket of ſtones to the ſtrengthning of the walles of that Ieruſalem, whereof (by grace) wee are all both Citizens and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And now to returne to thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience hath not yet taught, and whom proſperitie will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to awake: I earneſtlie beſeech them both in the Lord, no longer to deceiue themſelues with vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, neither to ſuffer their hearts ſo to be tied to earthlie vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they ſhould deſpiſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thoſe things that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truely make them happie indeed. When it ſhall pleaſe GOD to open their eyes to diſcerne betweene heauenlie and earthly, betweene things tranſitorie, and things euerlaſting, I know they
<pb facs="tcp:18666:5"/>will of themſelues bee aſhamed of this their negligence. For what are all the pleaſant things of this world, which moſt bewitch the minds of men, if they be compared with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie and eternall things? If ſtatelie &amp; ſumptuous buildings do delight; what building is ſo ſtatelie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as newe Ieruſalem? If riches; what ſo rich as that, whoſe paueme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is of pure gold, whoſe foundations and walls of precious ſtones, &amp; gates of orient pearles? If friends, kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke and neighbours; what Citie ſo repleniſhed as this, where God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Maieſtie, Ieſus Chriſt the head of the Church in his glorie, &amp; all the holie Angels, Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles and Martirs do dwel together in happineſſe for euer? If honor; what honor comparable to this, to be the ſeruant and child of ſo mightie a King, and heire of ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a kingdome; where neither
<pb facs="tcp:18666:5"/>time doth conſume, nor enuie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue of honour, nor power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie ſpoyle of glorie, that is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible? If then there be no compariſon betweene things heauenlie and things that are earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and no man can attaine to the things that are heauenlie, but by the ſame way that Chriſt himſelfe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto them; which was by the croſſe: why (caſting off all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that preſſeth downe) doo we not runne on our courſe with chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and hope, hauing Chriſt ſo mightie a King, for our Captaine &amp; guide, who (as the Apoſtle ſaith) for the glorie that was ſet before him, indured the croſſe, and deſpiſing the ſhame, ſitteth now at the right hand of the throne of God? How ſlowe and dull of heart are wee, if as <hi>Eſau,</hi> (who for a meſſe of pottage ſold his birthright) wee are contented for a ſmall and ſhort pleaſure in this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:18666:6"/>world, to leeſe that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and euerlaſting glorie, which Chriſt the ſonne of GOD with ſo great a price hath purchaſed for vs. The Lord giue vs wiſedome to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, &amp; grace to heare his voice while it is ſaide to day, that when daies and nights &amp; times ſhall ceaſe, wee may (without time) enter into his ioye and reſt which neuer ſhall haue end.

2.7.</note> is to be vnited vnto the ſonne of God in one perſon, and that this his diuinitie ſhall be for the moſt part as it were, hid vntil that day, and that then it ſhall bee fullie reuealed: how much more the diuine maieſtie of the ſonne of God, ſhall cauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the ſonne of man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, ſo much the greater ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the glorie of this ſonne of man vnited in one perſon to the Godhead then raigning in his full maieſtie and glorie. As (if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may find any thing neuer ſo little to repreſent this high myſterie) wee may conſider, that the felicitie and glorie of the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſo much the greater,<note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> that by the greatnes of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> exalted to the gouernment of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they were ſubiect vnto him, and there appeared a great difference between <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his brethren, not by the diminiſhing of them, but by the increaſing of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> his brethren hauing this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:18666:15"/>and honor, to be the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſo much more great and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by how much, the greatnes of the maieſtie &amp; glorie of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> made their ſubiection more to appeare. And this is it that may in ſome ſort be noted in the church.

Hereof alſo it followeth, that our chiefe felicitie ſhalbe to behold this glorie of Chriſt. And indeed this is that benefite and happines which he asked for vs of God his father, ſaying: Father,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.24.</note> my deſire for thoſe whome thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me, is, that they bee where I am, and that they may ſee my glorie.

Aske of thy ſoule if thou were capable of the ioy, which thou ſhouldeſt feele of one ſuch felicitie. But if beſides, any other who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou loueſt as thy ſelfe, ſhould inioye the ſame happines with thee, ſurelie this ſuperabounding ioy which thou ſhouldeſt feele of thine own happines, ſhould it not be twiſe doubled, for the glorie &amp; the ioy of him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18666:16"/>as thy ſelf, &amp; for whoſe happines, thou ſhouldeſt bee as ioyfull as for thine owne happines? Now, if there were two, three, yea a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the ſame happines with thee, whom alſo thou louedſt as thy ſelfe, thou ſhouldeſt feele as much ioy for the happines of each of them, as for thine owne happines. What then ſhall be in this perfect charitie, when wee ſhall loue all the bleſſed angels, and all the elect, louing euerie each one of them euen as our ſelues, and being no leſſe ioyfull of the felicitie of each of them, than of our owne? Surelie if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a one of the elect ſhall be capable of his owne ioy for the greatnes of it, how ſhall he bee capable of ſo manie ioyes for the happines of ſo manie of the elect, for whom he ſhall feele as much ioy, as for his owne? Loe what it is Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith. But yet how much ſhall this ioy be augmented for the happines, felicitie and glorie of this elect of God, in whome wee our ſelues haue been elected, who hauing died for the elect, ſhall ſanctifie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:18666:17"/>and lift them vp into heauen to the inioying of this felicitie? who is not onlie man holie and iuſt, but alſo true God, eſpeciallie beholding him in his glorie, to bee vnited in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Godhead then ſhining in his Maieſtie. Surelie if wee, louing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elect as our ſelues, ſhould haue as much ioy of the happines of each of them, as of our own, what ſhall be the ioy that we ſhall receiue of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and glorie of this ſoueraigne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Ieſus Chriſt, whom by good right we ſhould loue more than our ſelues? See then more than a ſea of ioy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the happines of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. Let vs now vnderſtand the great deapth of ioy which we ſhall feele, entering into the ioye of our Lord. The cauſe why wee ſhould loue God (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) is God him ſelfe.<note place="margin">Bernard in tract. de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendo deo.</note> And the meaſure which wee ought to keepe in this loue, is to loue him without meaſure, and ſo, infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18666:17"/>darknes; euen ſo very little and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure is the loue which we beare him. But when wee ſhall knowe him as he is, wee ſhall loue him according as he is. What ſhall our loue bee towards him then,<note place="margin">1.

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt this contemplation of the glory of the diuine maieſtie ſhal bring forth in vs an infinite loue towards God. Now (to returne to the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) if according to that we loue each one, wee ſhould reioyce of his happines. Then as in this bleſſed felicitie each one of vs ſhall loue God without compariſon, more than himſelfe, and more than all the Angels and elect with vs: ſo ſhall we feele more ioy without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb facs="tcp:18666:18"/>of the bleſſednes and glorie of God, than of our owne, or of al the Angels and the elect with vs. And if then wee ſhall loue God with all our heart, with all our ſoule, with all our vnderſtanding: yet ſo as al our hart, al our vnderſtanding, and all our ſoule ſhall not be capable of the excellencie of this loue: Surelie wee ſhall ſo feele ioy with all our heart, with all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and with all our ſoule, as yet all our heart, al our vnderſtanding and all our ſoule ſhall not bee able to comprehend the fulnes of this ioye. Howſoeuer it bee then, that this full ioy, yea more than full, through the greatnes of it (whereof all our heart, all our vnderſtanding, &amp; all our ſoule ſhall not be capable) cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: It ſhall remaine that we, (filled with the ſea of ioye of the felicitie of the Angels, and of all the elect) ſhall enter into this great deapth of ioye proceeding from the contemplation of the glorie of our God. And this ſhalbe the ioy of the Lord,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.21.</note> into which all his faithfull ſeruants ſhall enter.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18666:18"/>Now, when this felicitie ſo great, and ioy incomprehenſible, ſhall indure ſo manie yeares as there bee drops of water in the ſea,<note place="margin">Of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the life to come</note> or graines of ſand in the whole earth, yet ſhould not this be a perfect happines. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the continuance ſhall ſeeme to vs infinite, yet the end will once come. And indeed the drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the graines of the ſand are numbred before God. But this our felicitie and ioy ſhal laſt without end. Such ſhall bee the life euerlaſting: As alſo Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.5. 1. Tim. 1.17.</note> we ſhall raigne in heauen world without end.

<pb facs="tcp:18666:19"/>For as the fountain of this life which we ſhall inioy, hath no beginning, ſo the life that procedeth from it, ſhall haue no end. The mercie of GOD (ſaith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) is from eternitie to eternitie vppon thoſe that feare him; from eternitie, becauſe of the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination; to eternitie, becauſe of the glorification: The one hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the other hath no ending.

Furthermore, when after wee haue proteſted in our Creede, that wee beleeue the holie Church vniuerſall, we adde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, the forgiuenes of ſinnes, the riſing againe of the bodie, and the life euerlaſting: is not this to aſſure vs that thoſe that are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, haue a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in all theſe treaſures and goods of it, and conſequently that they are the children of God, and inheritours of euerlaſting life? According vnto this S. <hi>Luke</hi> alſo ſaith reſolutlie,<note place="margin">Act. 2.47.</note> that God ioyned vnto the Church thoſe that ſhould be ſaued. The which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.32.</note> that there ſhall be ſaluation in Sion. And S. <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe ſticketh not at all,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 1.4</note> to call thoſe that are the members of the Church, the elect of God. But yet ſo much the more to reſolue vs, let vs conſider the marks of the true church touched here before. The firſt is, the pure preaching of the word of God. Now, Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, my ſheepe heare my voyce, and they follow me:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.27.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:18666:21"/>ſhewing thereby very manifeſtly, that this is one marke to bee the child of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.47.</note> to heare the voyce of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: As alſo he ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.18 Ephe. 6.15. Act. 14.3. Act.
20.32. Act. 13.26. Act 5.20. Phil. 2.15.</note> that is of God, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the voyce of God. And indeed, ſeeing that the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell is called the miniſterie of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, the Goſpell of peace, the word of grace, of ſaluation and of life, (as without doubt, God by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of his word, preſenteth Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, peace, grace, ſaluation and life): So they that are the members of the Church, heare and receiue the word, ſhew therein, that they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of all theſe benefites, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie, the children of God. The ſecond mark of the Church conſiſteth in the Sacraments of Baptiſme and of the Lords ſupper. As touching Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it is a ſeale &amp; ſure warrant that the ſinnes of thoſe that receiue it are waſhed away by the bloud of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Act. 22.5. Rom. 6.4. Tit. 3.5. Gal. 3.27.</note> that they are ingrafted and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into his death and reſurrection: that they are regenerate, &amp; that they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18666:21"/>haue put on Ieſus Chriſt. Whereof it followeth, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.26.</note> that they are the children of God. The like aſſurance of our adoption is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs in the Lords ſupper. For if the bread and the cup,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16.</note> which are giuen to the members of the Church, are the communion of the bodie and of the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in this communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, they haue the foode and life of their ſoules. And that conſequentlie, as the children of GOD, they ſhall obtaine life euerlaſting, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Chriſt. He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.54.</note> he hath euerlaſting life. The third marke of the Church of God, is the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the name of God, in the name of that onlie one leſus Chriſt. Now,<note place="margin">Pſal. 14 4. Gen.
12.7. Act. 2.21. Act. 9.14.</note> as all the ſeruice of God is oftentimes ſignified by this inuocation: So Saint <hi>Luke</hi> noteth the faithful and children of God by this deſcription, that they call vpon the name of the Lord. As on the contrarie ſide,<note place="margin">Pſal.
14.4.</note> it is ſaid of the reprobate, that they do not call vpon
<pb facs="tcp:18666:22"/>the name of God. And indeede when the members of the Church ioyne together and lift vp their praiers vnto God,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.9.</note> ſaying: Our Father which art in heauen: and ſo calling him father, by the commandement of Chriſt, they may well aſſure themſelues that God doth acknowledge them for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that he wil make them feele the fruit of their praiers, according to the promiſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat.
18.19.</note> that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſhall with one conſent aske of GOD, it ſhall bee giuen them. By this that is aboue ſaid, it manifeſtlie appeareth, how euerie member of the Church may and ought to aſſure him ſelfe to be the child of God, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all other members of the Church with him in like manner to be the children of God. If any alledge that we may thus accompt ſuch a one for the child of God, who poſsiblie is an hypocrite, and may after ſhewe himſelfe a reprobate, we anſwere, that ſuch diſcourſes are contrarie to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſo much recommended vnto vs by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> noting amongſt other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18666:22"/>properties of charitie, that ſhe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not euill, or is not ſuſpitious, but that ſhe beleeueth all things, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all things. Wee ought then to hold the members of the Church, for the children of GOD. vntill that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from it, or diſcouering their hypocriſie, they ſhewe themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates. Furthermore, as GOD would that al thoſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to bee father, ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Church for their mother: ſo let vs not doubt, but being borne againe, and nouriſhed in the Church our mother, we may call God our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and abiding vnited to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the mother, let vs not doubt but that wee bee the heires of the father. Thus much for the outward markes.</p>
            <p>Now let vs come to the inwarde markes. As to the blind and deaffe the opening of their eyes and eares is needfull, clearelie to ſee and heare the voyce of him that ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marks of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> So being of our owne nature both blind and deaffe as touching vnderſtanding, the holie ſpirit is hee, that openeth our

A ccording where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.</note> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that the Holie ghoſt giueth teſtimonie to our ſpirits that we are the children of God, ſo as hauing receiued this ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee crie with all aſſurance, Abba father.<note place="margin">1.

<hi>Paule</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> that by the peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which we feele in our conſciences before GOD in the free forgiuenes of our ſinnes by the bloud of Ieſus
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18666:23"/>Chriſt, we ſhewe and prooue that wee are iuſtified by faith, and ſo the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. Wherein to confirme vs, he ſaith in another place, that after wee haue beleeued, wee are ſealed by the holie ſpirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt penie of our inheritance,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.13.</note> vntill the redemption of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion purchaſed to the praiſe of his glorie. Firſt he ſheweth there, that faith is as it were the ſeale whereby the Holie ghoſt imprinteth in our hearts for our aſſurance, that wee are the children of God. Furthermore, as in a thing that is bought there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giuen an earneſt penie, to wit, ſome part of the monie agreed on, as well for the beginning of the paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as by conſequent, for the aſſurance that the bargaine ſhall be held firme: ſo the holie ghoſt, who by faith inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth peace and ioye in the hearts of the faithfull, is the earneſt penie, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs, by this beginning, of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſsings which God promiſeth to his children, that he holdeth vs for his poſſeſsion, purchaſed to the praiſe
<pb facs="tcp:18666:24"/>of his glorie, and that at the length he will gather vs into the full inioying of the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of heauen. Hereunto it is alſo, that goodly gradatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, which is propoſed of the ſame Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> ſaying: Thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath before knowne, thoſe hee hath alſo predeſtinate to be made like vnto the image of Ieſus Chriſt: and thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath predeſtinate, he hath alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and thoſe whom he hath called, he hath alſo iuſtified: and thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath iuſtified, thoſe he hath alſo glorified. For all will confeſſe, that thoſe that are elected and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be made like vnto the image of Ieſus Chriſt, are the children of God, as alſo they, who in his eternall counſel and decree are glorified.

It behoueth that herein faith helpe vs, and that trueth ſuccour vs. That that, which is hid concerning vs in the heart of the father, may bee reuealed vnto vs by the ſpirit, and his ſpirit teſtifying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, may perſwade vs that wee are the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God; that he perſwade it vs, I ſay, in calling and iuſtifying vs freelie by faith, which is as it were a meane or paſſage from the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of GOD to the glorie of the life euerlaſting. The ſame thing is it which S <hi>Augustine</hi> meaneth, ſaying:<note place="margin">Aug Hom. in Ioan. <hi>35.</hi>
               </note> Wee are come into the way of faith,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:25"/>let vs hold it conſtantlie, it ſhall leade vs from degree to degree euen vnto the chamber of the heauenlie King, where all the treaſures of knowledge and wiſedome beeing hid, wee may learne and behold the reuelation of our election. From hence proceedeth yet another fruite ſeruing vs for a marke to aſſure vs more &amp; more that we are the children of God, when we loue God, and our neighbours for his ſake: whereof alſo followeth the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of euill, and an earneſt deſite to render obedience to God. For if it be ſo as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.19</note> that our loue to God commeth of this, that he hath firſt loued vs: The loue that we beare vnto him, is a teſtimonie that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs. As alſo Ieſus Chriſt maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and ſheweth, that by the ſignes of loue,<note place="margin">Luk.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18666:25"/>the heate that is felt in the ſtones ſet againſt the Sunne, is a ſigne that the Sunne ſhineth vppon them. Of our owne nature and firſt generation we are vnprofitable to all goodnes, and inclined to al euill,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.10.</note> as Saint

The tree is knowne by his fruit, ſaith Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Matt 7.17.</note> If then wee beare the fruit of iuſtice, holines and of charitie, wee are trees planted in the garden of God by his holie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo conſequentlie the childen of God. Charitie, ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.7.</note> is of God, and he that loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God. As then the heate and light of a coale is a ſigne that it hath fire: and as the moouing and actions of the bodie are certaine ſignes, that it liueth, &amp; that the ſoule is within it: ſo the teſtimonie of the
<pb facs="tcp:18666:26"/>holie ghoſt in our hearts, the peace &amp; quietnes of our conſciences before GOD, feeling our ſelues iuſtified by faith; this loue towards God and our neighbour, this chaunge of our life, and deſire to walke in the feare and obedience of God, are aſſured tokens of our adoption: as alſo this, that we are members of the Church of Chriſt hearing his word, participating with the holie Sacraments, and calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, are teſtimonies that wee are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and houſhold ſeruants of God, and heires of eternall life.</p>

The other temptation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other where, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth ſpeciallie in two points. To wit, in the reuolt of ſome hauing made profeſsion of the true religion: and in the grieuous and long afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are ordinarie to thoſe that followe the doctrine of the Goſpell. Now, as there is nothing of greater importance than the ſaluation of the ſoule: ſo there is nothing that doth more grieuouſlie afflict and trouble the tender conſciences deſirous of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, than the doubts &amp; feares not to be the child of God, getting to themſelues hereby ſuch ſorowes and anguiſhes, as none are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:27"/>but thoſe that haue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues felt and tried them. To helpe then, to the conſolation of the ſoules ſo daungerouſlie, and ſo mightelie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: firſt it is to be noted, that this diſeaſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to many of this, that they pretend to reſolue themſelues of their ſaluation, examining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues whether they be worthie to be the children of God or no. And as there is none that is, or can bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, ſo this is at the laſt to turne doubts into deſpaire. Other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whether they bee of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the elect, and whether their names bee written in the booke of life, to wit, if God loue them, and hold them for his children. But it is not ſo high, that we muſt mount, but in the doctrine of the Goſpell it is, where we ſhould ſearch the reuelation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and reſolue our ſelues if God hath loued vs, if he doo loue vs, and will hold vs for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Ieſus Chriſt. For as a man if he be of credite, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the hid thoughts of his heart to bee knowne by ſpeaking: euen ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18666:27"/>God, who is the trueth it ſelfe, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto vs, by the preaching of the Goſpell, his counſell, and his will tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our adoption &amp; ſaluation: and confirmeth this reuelation by the vſe of the holie Sacraments. But we muſt note, that this reuelation of the will of God in the Goſpel comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth firſt two poynts: to wit, that there is perfect &amp; entire ſaluation in one only Ieſus Chriſt, and that the meane to obtaine it, is to beleeue in him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, when this Goſpell is preached vnto vs, GOD reuealeth vnto vs yet two poynts more: firſt, that he will make vs partakers of this ſaluation in Chriſt. Secondlie, that he will haue vs to beleeue the teſtimonie that he hath giuen vs of this his will, to the end that we might bee ſaued. Now, the difficultie of beleeuing lieth in the perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe two laſt points, which notwithſtanding are certaine and true. Behold, ſaith S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.11</note> the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of God, which he hath giuen vs of euerlaſting life, and this life is in his ſonne, he ſaith not onelie that
<pb facs="tcp:18666:28"/>the life is in his ſonne, but ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he giueth vs this life, &amp; that the Goſpell is the witnes. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing proteſted a little before, that he which beleeueth not this teſtimonie of God,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.10</note> maketh him a lier: he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſufficientlie that he will that wee ſhould beleeue it. The Apoſtle to the
<hi>Hebrues</hi> paſſeth further, &amp; ſaith; that God,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> willing to ſhew the immutable ſtablenes of his counſell to the heires of the promiſe, interpoſeth himſelfe by an oth, that by two things immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in which it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie, wee might haue firme conſolation, wee, I ſay, who haue our refuge to the hope that is ſet before vs, the which we hold as the ancker of the ſoule ſure &amp; ſtable, pearcing euen into the ſanctuarie of heauen, where Ieſus Chriſt our forerunner is ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs. By this he teacheth vs firſt, that when we heare the Goſpell, wee ought to hold for certaine, that the counſell of God which was hid in his heart, touching his will to ſaue vs, and to take vs for his children, is there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18666:28"/>made manifeſt vnto vs. Secondly, that he will that wee beleeue it, ſeeing he confirmeth it by two things immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, in which he cannot lie, to wit, his word and his oth, to the end that wee might haue firme conſolation, which cannot bee in vs, if we beleeue not. Moreouer, he calleth the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his counſell, the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs. Speaking then to vs, he would that we ſhould haue hope: yea and he will that this reuealing of his counſell ſhould be vnto vs a ſure anchor of the ſoule, to ſhewe, that as a ſhip is held faſt by the anchor, that it might not be carried away of the wind: ſo God would that this reuealing of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell by the doctrine of the Goſpell ſhould hold vs faſt, &amp; aſſure vs againſt all doubts of our adoption, yea and to pearce euen into the verie heauens with aſſurance, whereof our forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Ieſus Chriſt hath taken poſſeſsion both for himſelfe, and for vs. See then one place ſhewing very expreſlie, that when thou heareſt the Goſpell, God declareth and reuealeth vnto thee,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:29"/>that it is his will to ſaue thee by his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. And to this end he will further, that thou beleeue it. And indeed when S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ro. 10.17.</note> that faith commeth by hearing the Goſpell, he ſheweth that thou canſt not beleeue, except that thou heare. Now, faith is a knowledge and certaintie, that it is the will of God to ſaue thee, &amp; to take thee for his welbeloued child in Ieſus Chriſt. Then it followeth, that the Goſpell which is preached vnto thee, and which thou heareſt, conteineth the reuealing and teſtimonie: firſt, that it is the will of God to ſaue thee by Chriſt: ſecondlie, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt beleeue this teſtimonie which he giueth thee, that thou maieſt haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life. Who now is he, that ought or can doubt? Seeing alſo he is not content to ſay in generall,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.36.</note> he that beleeueth hath euerlaſting life: but he commandeth thee to beleeue. Beleeue (ſaith he) the Goſpell.<note place="margin">Mar. 1.15.</note> Alſo, This is his commandement, ſaith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.23</note> that wee beleeue in the name of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. Now, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18666:29"/>the Goſpell, or in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, is not onelie to beleeue that there is ſaluation in Chriſt, and that he that beleeueth in him hath life euerlaſting. For the diuell himſelfe beleeueth that, and yet he beleeueth not the Goſpell, neither in the name of Ieſus Chriſt. But this is to beleeue, that he hath ſaluation in Chriſt for thee, as
<hi>Eſai</hi> ſaith: A child is borne to vs, a ſonne is giuen to vs.<note place="margin">Eſay. 9.5.</note> And ſo ſpeaketh the Angell to the ſhepheards. This day is borne vnto you a ſauiour. Alſo,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.11.</note> that it is the will of God that thou ſhouldeſt be his child, and thou ſhouldeſt beleeue it ſo. The which thing the diuell ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not beleeue for himſelfe: neither is the Goſpell offered vnto him. Now, when GOD reuealeth vnto thee his good will and loue towards thee, wherefore doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou? He is true, he neither will, nor can either lie or deceiue. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commaundeth thee to beleeue it, muſt thou examine thy ſelfe whether thou bee worthie or no? Thou art bound to obey, &amp; ſo to beleeue, that
<pb facs="tcp:18666:30"/>he doth loue thee, and that thou art his child by Chriſt. Call to mind that which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> whoſoeuer beleeueth (what manner a one, or whoſoeuer it be) he hath life euerlaſting. Neither is it preſumption ſo to beleeue, and that conſtantly, but it is to him obedience moſt acceptable. And indeed it is an honour that he requireth of thee to beleeue his word, and ſo to put to thy ſeale that he is true. It is verie true that in preaching the Goſpell, hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.39.</note> not, I am come to ſaue Simon Peter, Cornelius the Centurion, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Magdalen, and ſo of others. He nameth no man by his name that was giuen him by men, either at their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or at their baptiſme, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: for ſo might we yet doubt of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinking that it might be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not of vs, but of ſome other that ſhould haue the ſame name. But when thou heareſt that Ieſus Chriſt is come to ſaue ſinners: either renounce the name of a ſinner,<note place="margin">Matt. 9.13. 1. Timo. 1.15.</note> or confeſſe that hee ſpeaketh to thee, and that hee is come to ſaue thee. Make then boldly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18666:30"/>this concluſion: Ieſus Chriſt is come to ſaue ſinners, I acknowledge my owne name, for I am a ſinner: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is come to ſaue me. And alſo when he ſaith: Come vnto men all ye that trauaile &amp; are heauilie laden,<note place="margin">Math. 11.28.</note> and I will refreſh you: Thou muſt marke well theſe words, all ye; for ſeeing he ſaith, all ye, he ſpeaketh to all thoſe that trauaile and feele the heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their ſinnes. Wherfore ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou doubt then, whether hee ſpeake to thee? Conclude rather on this manner, ſeeing he ſaith, all ye, he ſpeaketh then alſo to me, promiſing to comfort me. And to this purpoſe ſaith S. <hi>Paule,</hi> that there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of men before GOD,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.12.</note> but the ſame who is Lord ouer all, is rich towards all thoſe that call vppon him: Haue thou then recourſe vnto him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, &amp; thou art aſſured that he will alſo be rich in mercie euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. If there were two or three hundred inhabitants of ſome towne baniſhed for ſome offence, and after a generall pardon ſhould be publiſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:31"/>that all the baniſhed of ſuch a towne ſhould haue free libertie to returne thether, with all aſſurance to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vppon all their goods and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors: ſuppoſe that thou wert one of thoſe baniſhed, and that he that hath giuen the pardon were a faithfull and true Prince: wouldeſt not thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that thou wert comprehended in the pardon, although thy name were no more expreſſed, than the names of the other baniſhed, and that returning to the towne thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt againe bee placed in thy goods? Now,<note place="margin">Gen.
3.24.</note> we haue bin baniſhed from the kingdome of heauen by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion of Adam. Ieſus Chriſt dying for theſe baniſhed perſons, cauſeth a generall pardon to bee publiſhed by the preaching of the Goſpell, with permiſsion, yea with commandement to returne into heauen. He is a true King, yea the trueth it ſelfe: and the aboliſhing of this baniſhment, &amp; the reentrie into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath coſt him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deere,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.19.</note> euen the ſhedding of his moſt precious bloud. What occaſion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18666:31"/>then haſt thou to doubt of thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, &amp; returne into heauen? For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thy Chriſtian name bee not expreſſed; yet if thou be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the baniſhed, he ſpeaketh to thee, behold thy name, thou art there comprehended. Beleeue that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in trueth, and that his wil is ſuch towards thee, as he declareth to thee by his word. But let vs paſſe further to the Sacraments, which ſerue great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to reſolue vs to beleeue that wee are the children of God. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are (as it were) a viſible word,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioan. hom. <hi>19.</hi>
               </note> repreſenting the grace of the Goſpel. But more then that, they are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to thee, and thou receiueſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Is not this to put thee, as it were, into reall poſſeſsion of thine adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to giue thee aſſurance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life? The Paſtour preacheth vnto all, the grace of the Goſpell in the name of Chriſt. But in thy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme he directeth his ſpeach to thee by name, to aſſure thee of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of thy ſinnes, and of thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that thoſe

<pb facs="tcp:18666:32"/>that are baptiſed haue put on Chriſt, and that ſo they are the children of God.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.26.</note> And it is as if a Prince hauing called backe againe all the baniſhed, amongſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſhouldeſt be one, calling vnto thee by name, amongſt the other baniſhed, by a letter ſealed of thy pardon, and of reeſtabliſhing thee in thy goods. Should not this be to aſſure thee? As touching the holy ſupper, Ieſus Chriſt, hauing publiſhed by his Miniſter, that his fleſh is meate indeed and his bloud drinke, addeth, that whoſoeuer eateth his fleſh and drinketh his bloud,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.55.56.</note> he hath life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: He calleth thee among others to his table, and giueth thee of the bread and wine, namelie, to aſſure thy perſon, that he died for thee, and that he giueth thee his bodie &amp; his bloud, yea himſelfe all whole, and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, that thou ſhouldeſt bee with him, the child of God, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of life euerlaſting. If the diuell or thy conſcience trouble thee, to doubt of thine adoption, aſſure thy ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a temptation, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18666:32"/>of the holie ſupper. Say boldlie, Satan, canſt thou denie that I haue been at the holie ſupper, &amp; that I haue receiued bread and wine? I haue ſeen, touched and taſted it, thou canſt not denie it. Further, canſt thou denie that this bread and wine were giuen me for ſeales and ſure pledges of my communicating with the body and bloud of Chriſt?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16.</note> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith plainlie, that the bread which I haue receiued, is the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of leſus Chriſt. Seeing then thou canſt not denie, but that I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the bread and wine: and that the bread and wine are the communion of the body &amp; of the bloud of Chriſt, I haue then communion with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; thou canſt not denie it. True it is that there are ſome, who being outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church, baptiſed in it, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, and communicating at the holie ſupper, ſhewe themſelues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hypocrites, declaring that they were neuer indeede the children of God. But wee cannot ſay therefore,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:33"/>that the reuelation and teſtimonie of the will of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in his word, and ſealed by the Sacraments, are doubtfull or vncertaine. For GOD, who offereth his grace in his word, and hath ſealed it by the Sacraments, is faithful and ſpeaketh truelie, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto vs and aſſuring vs that he will take vs for his welbeloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Ieſus Chriſt. And he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie nor deceaue, as is alreadie ſaid. But theſe are vnfaithfull men, who reiecting the teſtimonies of the will of GOD towards them, depriue themſelues by their incredulitie of the grace which was offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doing this diſhonor to Chriſt, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt him a lier.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.10</note> As the Sunne then ceaſeth not to giue light and brightnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome man ſhutteth his eyes that he may not ſee it, nor bee lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and as meate ceaſeth not to bee good and nouriſhing, although it be receiued without profite of a ſtomack euill diſpoſed: So, if manie vnwilling to beleeue that the will of GOD is ſuch, as he hath declared by his word,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18666:33"/>reiecting (by their incredulitie) the grace which GOD offereth them; ſhould their incredulitie make thee call in doubt the trueth of God, and the teſtimonie of his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee? If ſome few among theſe baniſhed, not truſting the pardon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a true and faithfull Prince, doo him this diſhonor to compt him as a deceiuer or lier: acknowledge thou that iuſtlie and by good right they remaine baniſhed. But thou, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that faithfull Prince Ieſus Chriſt hath ſent to pronounce vnto thee a generall pardon, and namelie, hath giuen thee his letters ſealed by the Sacraments, commaunding thee to beleeue, and promiſing thee, that it ſhall bee vnto thee according to thy faith: Aſſure thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Matt. 9.29.</note> that his will is that thou ſhouldeſt be his child, and heire of euerlaſting life. See how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one ſhould aſſure himſelfe, by the preaching of the Goſpell, and the vſe of the Sacraments, the true markes of the Church: that (being a member of it) he is the child of God: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:34"/>an inheritour of his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome. True it is, that faith is the gift of GOD, yea proceeding from the operation of the mightie power of his ſtrength,<note place="margin">Phili. 1.29.

It is therefore needfull that he worke farther with vs by his holie ſpirit, which (without ceaſing) asking of him in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, we are aſſured by his promiſe, that he will giue vs, and that, ſo ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the power and efficacie of his ſpirit, the preaching of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the vſe of the Sacraments, he will giue vs grace to applie vnto our ſelues (by a true and liuelie faith) the teſtimonies which he hath giuen vs of our adoption, to our ſaluation and euerlaſting life.</p>

Betweene the ſpirit and the fleſh: betweene faith and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt. There is then in them faith aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed with doubts, and the ſpirit figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt miſtruſt, and labouring to ouercome it. Theſe doubts, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtings, and incredulities are the fierie darts which Satan throweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our faith, the which bearing the blowes, as a buckler, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith: thruſteth them back and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them, ſo as they pearce not to the heart.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.16.</note> What deuiſes or aſſaults ſoeuer the diuel make againſt vs, faith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſo he occupie not the place of the heart where faith dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, he is driuen backe. Incredulitie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18666:36"/>then aſſaulteth vs without, but woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs not deadlie: It troubleth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or ſo woundeth, as the ſtroake is yet curable. And ſuch temptations and aſſaults are common to the moſt faithfull &amp; excellent ſeruants of God. If wee conſider the continuall courſe of the life of <hi>Dauid,</hi> there is no mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of faith better to bee noted than in him. And yet was not he aſſaulted with great feares and doubts? What co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint maketh he in the 77. Pſalm? Hath the Lord forſaken for euer?<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.8, 9
10, 11, verſ.</note> will he no more ſhewe me fauour? Is his mercie cleane gone for euer? Is his promiſe come to an ende for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more? Hath God forgotten to bee gracious? Hath he ſhut vp his louing kindnes in diſpleaſure? And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he holdeth ſuch a courſe, as a man deſperate, ſaying: This is my death. Where was then in <hi>Dauid,</hi> the feeling of his faith? For al this he had not loſt it. And indeed all theſe words were but repreſentations of feare and diſpaire aſſailing the faith that was in him, and fighting againſt it: As hee
<pb facs="tcp:18666:37"/>ſheweth in other places verie plainly, ſaying: My ſoule, why art thou caſt downe,<note place="margin">Pſal 42.12. Pſal. 43.5.</note> why art thou ſo heauie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me? Put thy truſt in God, for I will yet giue him thanks, for as much as he is my manifeſt deliuerance (as it were before my face) and my God. If theſe teſtimonies of faith before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeeme ſmall: how ſmall and dark was the faith of the Apoſtles before the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt? They beleeue that Chriſt is the ſonne of God,<note place="margin">Mat 16.16 Iohn 6.69. Mat. 17.23 Luke 9.45. Luk 24.11 Act. 1.6.</note> the ſauiour of the world: but yet they vnderſtand not that he muſt die, and riſe againe: wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding lieth the principall reſt of our faith. Yea, and after his reſurrection they (acknowledge him for a King) imagined rather a carnall, than a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall kingdome. If their faith was darke in their vnderſtanding: it was alſo ſmall in their hearts, when they were offended at Chriſt, and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him: &amp; Peter himſelfe renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him.<note place="margin">Mat. 26 31 Mar. 14.27. Mar. 14.50. Mat. 26.70 Mar. 14.68</note> And yet we cannot ſay, that they were without faith, though it were then verie weake and ſmall. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18666:37"/>alſo when the ſhip being couered with flouds they cried to Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Luk. 22.32 Matt. 8.25.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaue vs, we periſh: he calleth them not infidels, but men of little faith, &amp; fearefull: ſhewing that they had ſome faith in them, though verie ſmall, and aſſailed with feare, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hauing recourſe vnto him, they were heard, and deliuered out of daunger. For he came not to breake the bruſed reede, nor to quench the ſmoaking flax: As <hi>Eſay</hi> foretold,<note place="margin">Eſa. 42 3. Matt. 12.18</note> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therby, that there are ſome of the children of God, weake as a bruſed reede, and hauing as little ſtrength of faith, as in ſteed of flaming, it ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth onlie. This ſmalnes and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of faith is verie aptlie noted by S. <hi>Paule,</hi> ſaying:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> that the righteouſnes of GOD is reuealed by the Goſpell from faith to faith. He ſheweth that there are degrees in faith, and that it happeneth to vs in the reuealing of the righteouſnes of GOD, by which we are iuſtified, as when we ſee one ſo farre off, as with much a do wee know him: but the neerer we approach, the
<pb facs="tcp:18666:38"/>more cleerelie we diſcerne him. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the children of God are like to that blind man, whoſe eyes Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,<note place="margin">Mar. 8.29.</note> but ſo at the beginning, as he ſawe men like trees, forthwith he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered his ſight, but yet troubled at the beginning, but afterward cleared. To bee ſhort, he who in the perſon of his Apoſtles hath taught vs to pray vnto God to increaſe our faith, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath children in whom it is weake,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.5.</note> and hath neede of increaſe. Alſo the chiefe wiſedome of the moſt perfect is to profite. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe wee muſt remember, that in all ſpirituall graces, there is nothing but beginnings and imperfections, in the moſt perfect, and moſt highlie exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this life. But that the perfection (to the which notwithſtanding wee muſt alwaies tend) and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment ſhall be in heauen. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there are two effects or fruits of faith, to wete, the reſt &amp; peace of the conſcience before God: and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which conſiſteth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the workes of the fleſh,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18666:38"/>and newnes of life. Now, as the reſt and peace of conſcience proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, is a teſtimonie that it is in vs, ſo is alſo ſanctification, and the deſire to walke in the feare and obedience of God. And indeed, faith is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of good workes. If then, one of theſe fruites be languiſhing, the other ſufficeth to aſſure vs that wee haue faith. As it is knowne that there is true and naturall fire, by the flame &amp; the heate, which are two effects and operations of fire: but if the flame ſhall become weake, the heate ſhall ſuffice to aſſure vs, that it is naturall, and not a painted fire. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if this fruit of thy faith be weake, to feele peace and reſt in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet thou feeleſt the other effect of faith, to wete, a deſire to the workes of the ſpirit, loue towards God, and deſire to walke in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: This fruit of thy faith is to thee a ſure teſtimonie that it is in thee, though but ſmal and weake. But thou wilt ſay: what comfort or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſaluation can a faith ſo weak
<pb facs="tcp:18666:39"/>and little giue me: I anſwere; It can aſſure thee of thine adoption. For ſo thou haue but one ſpark of true faith, thou art the child of God. Faith is of ſuch a force,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.20</note> that (following the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God) one onelie graine of it, though neuer ſo little, laieth hold on Ieſus Chriſt to ſaluation. Againe, it is properlie Ieſus Chriſt which ſaueth vs, &amp; not our faith: ſauing in ſo much as it is the inſtrument, and as it were the hand by which wee take hold on Ieſus Chriſt. Now, faith how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it bee taketh hold on Chriſt and receiueth him, not by halfes, but all whole: as an infant taketh and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with his little hand a whole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though he doth it not ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or ſurelie as a man. By the apple of our eye, though merueilous little, we ſee verie great mountaines, and the verie bodie of the Sunne, much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the whole earth: ſo our faith, though verie little, taketh and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all whole Ieſus Chriſt the ſunne of righteouſnes. He who (being in a darke tower) ſeeth not the light of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18666:39"/>the Sunne, but by a verie little hole, may notwithſtanding aſſure himſelfe, that the Sunne ſhineth vppon the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as well as he that ſeeth it by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen windowe, knoweth that it ſhineth vpon his houſe. Euen ſo although we are hindered by the cloudes of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, that we cannot ſee the Sunne of righteouſnes to ſhine vpon our ſoules in his brightnes: yet ſo that wee ſee but a little beame, wee know that the ſunne of life ſhineth vppon vs, which aſſureth vs that we are the children of God. Alſo whoſoeuer in this life ſhall haue the leaſt faith among all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, ſhall yet inioye Ieſus Chriſt all whole, and not a little or halfe ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the full accompliſhed ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternall life. For whoſoeuer beleeueth in Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi> ſhall not periſh,<note place="margin">Iho. 3.16</note> but haue life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting. Now, as this ought great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to comfort vs in the weakenes of our faith, ſo ought it to bee a ſharpe ſpurre to inforce vs to growe in faith, that feeling ſo much the more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and liuelie the peace and ioye of
<pb facs="tcp:18666:40"/>our conſciences, by the aſſurance that we are the children of God, wee may the more ſtronglie reſiſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and glorifie our God. There are others, who call their faith and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption in doubt,<note place="margin">2. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throgh the ſmalnes of our ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. Ia. 2.17.20.</note> ſaying: That true faith cannot be without good works. Now, I feele my ſelfe ſo miſerable a ſinner, that it maketh me to doubt of mine adoption. Indeed this is a thing greatlie to be lamented, that we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no better obedience vnto God, that there is in vs no greater zeale of his glorie, nor more feruent charitie towards our neighbours: and to be ſhort, no better amendement of life. But if thou haſt begun to hate &amp; flee ſinne, if thou feeleſt that thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at thy infirmities and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: If hauing offended God, thou feele a ſorrowe and griefe for it: if thou deſire to abſtaine: if thou auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the occaſions: if thou trauaileſt to doo thine indeuour: if thou praieſt to God to giue thee grace: All theſe holie affections proceeding from no other than from the Holie ghoſt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18666:40"/>ought to be vnto thee ſo manie pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and teſtimonies, that he is in thee:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5</note> As alſo Saint <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that as thoſe that delight in the workes of the fleſh, are of the fleſh. So on the other ſide, thoſe that delight in the workes of the ſpirit, are of the ſpirit. Theſe holie deſires then to the workes of the ſpirit, are teſtimonies of the ſpirit dwelling in thee. So as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus led by the ſpirit of God, thou art the child of God, ſaith Saint
<hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.14 Rom. 3.10</note> And indeed ſeeing the children of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> are naturallie inclined to all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and corruptions, it is a marke of regeneration, &amp; ſo of being the child of God, when contrarie to nature we are diſpleaſed with our infirmities, and fighting againſt them, wee deſire and indeuour to faſhion our ſelues according to the will of our GOD.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> God hath commaunded vs to loue him with all our heart, with all our vnderſtanding, and with al our ſoule. Now, as we cannot know God in this life, but in part, and darklie, ſo we can
<pb facs="tcp:18666:41"/>not loue him but in part,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.9.12. <hi>Aug. ad Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nif. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 7.</note> yea verie little. The perfection is reſerued for heauen as alſo S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith: All the faithfull ought earneſtlie to aſpire to this, that they may once appeare before God pure and without ſpot. But for as much as the beſt and moſt perfect eſtate that we can attaine vnto in this preſent life, is no other thing, than to profite from day to day: then ſhall we come to this marke, when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter putting off this ſinfull fleſh, wee ſhall cleaue fullie to our God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo, as the ſame author ſaith, when men ſpeake of the perfection of the children of God in this life: to this perfection is required the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of their imperfection. It is as well in trueth, as in humilitie that the Saincts acknowledge how imperfect they are. God deferreth the accompliſhment of our holines and charitie vntill the life to come, to the end that this pride (which taketh force through the increaſe of vertue) ſhould not ouerthrowe vs, but that walking in humilitie, God might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18666:41"/>his mercie in pardoning vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9</note> his power in ſuſtaining vs, and his truth in ſauing vs. And in deede there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more weake, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> than the proude, nor more ſtrong than the humble: For as the proude, truſting in himſelfe, who is nothing but vanitie, hath God his aduerſarie, who reſiſteth the proude;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.5. Iam. 4.6.</note> ſo the humble miſtruſting himſelfe, hath God for his ſtrength and ſaluation. God indeede in his lawe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a perfect obedience. But that which he looketh for of vs his children in this life, conſiſteth more in the deſire to obey, than in the obedience it ſelfe.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5</note> According whereunto hee ſaieth by his Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> I will ſpare them,<note place="margin">Mal. 3 17.</note> as a father dooth his owne ſonne that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him. If a child take paine to write well, or to do as he ſhould do anie other ſeruice that his father hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, although there be great want both in the writing, and in the other ſeruice; yet in bearing with him hee praiſeth him, and ſaieth that hee hath written well, hee had doone his duetie. Godlines, the loue towardes God, and
<pb facs="tcp:18666:42"/>the obedience that we owe vnto him, is often ſignified by the feare of God, the which alſo <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth the beginning of Wiſedome.<note place="margin">Pſa.

And wherefore?<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1</note> Becauſe there is no condemnation to thoſe, who thus fighting againſt the fleſh, walke after the ſpirit, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are in Ieſus Chriſt.

               <hi>Iewes</hi> deſired the comming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and asked it of God.

Ieſus Chriſt feeling and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the terrible gulphes of the fearful wrath of God vpon him for our ſinnes,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.39</note> prayed with ſtrong cries &amp; teares to God his Father that he might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the deepe pit of death.

In like manner, S. <hi>Paul</hi> praieth to God oftentimes that he<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:18666:46"/>would deliuer him from the Angell of Sathan that buffeted him, but GOD much better (as he himſelfe confeſſeth) gaue him to vnderſtand, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God was made perfect in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: ſo as he proteſteth, as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the frute of his praiers, thogh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than he thoght, that from that time forth he would reioice in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, &amp; woulde take delight in them, foraſmuch as being weake in himſelfe, he was ſtrong in God. So wee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund manie times commodities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this life, as health, goods, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, friends, or our country: and God depriuing vs of them, giueth vs ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces, patience, faith, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in God, and other like: yea, and our prayer tending onely vnto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, and enioying ſuch commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities appertaining vnto this life alone: GOD contrariwiſe depriueth vs of them, to keepe them for vs in heauen, and to giue vs euerlaſting enioying of them, as when wee are depriued of them, being perſecuted for his name. And that which more is, when wee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18666:46"/>feele weakenes in faith, negligence to heare the worde of GOD, coldneſſe in charitie, impatience in our afflictions, and we hauing asked of God graces co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I thinke well (wilt thou ſay) that thoſe that pray vnto God feruentlie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue conſtantlie in ſuch praiers, haue therin teſtimonies that they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, &amp; are aſſured to be heard.

And for this they are vexed and troubled: and in truth it is a great infirmitie, for the which we ought gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſpleaſed with our ſelues. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is common to all the children of God in general. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> reproouing thoſe of his time for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, ſheweth quickly the firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and after the remedie.<note place="margin">Chriſoſt.

It is becauſe the Diuel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well, that in ſpeaking of things of this world, thou deoſt him no hurt, &amp; therefore he ſuffereth thee to talk at thy pleaſure: but when he ſeeth, that thou
<pb facs="tcp:18666:48"/>ſetteſt thy ſelfe vpon thy knees to pray to God, he knoweth that thou goeſt to procure that, which is againſt his heart, &amp; to the ruine of his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e.

On the other ſide, if it happen that by affliction either of body

And thou ſhalt feele at the laſt that which is ſaid to ſicke men that haue loſt their taſt, that thy appetite will come to thee by eating: And that the word of God, and the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bread and wine in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſupper ſhall be to thee more ſweet,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 119.103.</note> than honie to the mouth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.11.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith.

            <p>Finally, there are ſome, who hauing had liuely feelings of their faith with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; ioy in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences,<note place="margin">The fift temptation by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God.</note> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king beſides in the feare of God, are afterwards greatlie troubled, when theſe graces ſeem to be dead in them, falling into doubt &amp; miſtruſt of their ſaluation, or into crimes &amp; ſinnes too vnworthie the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. For ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hereby indeuoureth to perſwade them, either that they neuer had the true faith, or that God hath caſt them off, taking from them the gifts and graces of his holie ſpirit: but both the one and the other concluſion is as falſe, as the author of them is a great lier. And indeede, if the trees which haue flouriſhed &amp; borne their fruite in ſommer, are in winter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite, without leaues, yea and without apparance of life: dooth it followe therefore either that they had not life in ſommer, or that they are dead in the winter. When men go to bed, they rake vp the fire which did
<pb facs="tcp:18666:51"/>burne: if thou marke it verie neere, there is no apparance either of heate, nor of brightnes: dooth it followe therfore, that there had been no fire, or that it is then quenched or dead. Contrariwiſe, hauing been couered ouer night, men kindle againe in the morning the ſame fire that was hid &amp; couered: and the trees that ſeemed to be dead in the winter, flouriſh and beare fruite a while after. If thou ſeeſt a drunken man, not hauing for a time the vſe of reaſon, nor anie feeling of it, wilt thou ſay therefore, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had a reaſonable ſoule, or that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had it, it is now dead? A bide a fewe houres and thou ſhalt be conuict of the contrarie. And ſo of that, that thou haſt not preſentlie the feeling or effects and fruites of faith, can it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that thou neuer haſt had them, or that hauing had them, thou haſt loſt them?<note place="margin">Matt. 26.74</note> When S. <hi>Peter</hi> renounced Ieſus Chriſt three times, curſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, was his faith quenched? On the contrarie, Ieſus Chriſt hauing praied to God that his faith ſhould not faile,<note place="margin">Luk.
22.31</note>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:18666:51"/>and being without doubt heard, faith remained in him, but verie weake and ſore beaten, but not deſtroyed nor quenched. <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing committed adulterie &amp; murther,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> acknowledged his ſinnes and offences, praying to God that he would not take his holie ſpirit from him. Then he had not loſt it, rather it abode in him but as a fire couered with aſhes ſo as it is ſaid; without hauing anie feeling of it to keepe him from ſuch a headlong fall. Faith then may bee in a man without kindling: and being kindled, it is not out, although it be not perceiued for a time. Yea, but (wilt thou ſay) the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> ſheweth that there be ſome,<note place="margin">Heb. 6 4, 5,
6.</note> who hauing been ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, hauing taſted the heauenlie gift, hauing been partakers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt, and taſted the good word of God, and the power of the world to come, fall backe and leeſe theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea without hope euer to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them againe. What aſſurance then can I haue that faith abideth in me, and that GOD will yet make me to
<pb facs="tcp:18666:52"/>feele it hereafter? For as he hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed mercie vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to Saint
<hi>Peter;</hi> ſo dooth hee exerciſe his iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vpon other, as vpon thoſe of whome the Apoſtle ſpake before. Wee denie not but that there bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates that are greatlie lightened in the knowledge of the myſteries of ſaluation (which the Apoſtle termeth here to bee partakers of the holie ghoſt) and yet that ſuch apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, taſtings and feelings as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth followe not thereof. For, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or hearing the teſtimonies and repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the mercies of God toward his Church, of the loue of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt towards his elect, and of the excellencie and felicitie of eternall life, they conceaue theſe things in their vnderſtanding, &amp; for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them, they are after a ſort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and when they talke of them, they ſeeme to be partakers of them. But the difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them &amp; the children of God, lieth chieflie in this, that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and feelings of the reprobat
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18666:52"/>are ſuch, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or telling of an hiſtorie, which toucheth vs nothing at all: but the feelings of the children of God are as of a matter that toucheth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>Let vs conſider for example the hiſtorie of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Who is hee that reading attentiuelie, how <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſold of his brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> carried into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> put in priſon: and the ſorrowe that <hi>Iacob</hi> had,<note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> vnderſtanding that he was deuoured of a wilde beaſt, that would not bee mooued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion towardes <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Iacob?</hi> Who is hee that reading how <hi>Ioſeph</hi> beeing able to containe himſelfe no longer,<note place="margin">Gen.
45.</note> made himſelfe knowne to his brethren, and how weeping and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out hee ſaide vnto them: I am <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is my father yet aliue, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come neere vnto him, ſaid, I am <hi>Ioſeph</hi> your brother who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye ſold, but be not ſorie. Shew to my father al my glorie: Then throwing himſelfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the neck of <hi>Beniamin</hi> his brother, he wept, and in like manner <hi>Beniamin</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18666:53"/>wept vpon his necke: after kiſsing all his brethren hee wept vppon them. Who is he, I ſay, which is not touched and weepeth not with them? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a hiſtorie of the fact of an other, theſe motions &amp; feelings ſoon paſſe away, ſo as hauing turned the leaſe or talked of another matter, all theſe feelings are vaniſhed and gone. So is the feeling of the reprobate, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or reading the teſtimonies of ſo great a mercie of God towards men, and of the greatnes of the happines of the kingdome of heauen: The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding &amp; apprehenſion of theſe things, cauſeth ſome motions or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in them, as the Apoſtle ſaith. But for as much as theſe good things appertaine not vnto them, neither do the feelings that they haue, take anie ſeate or roote in their hearts, but are eaſilie quenched and vaniſh away. On the contrary, the feeling that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God haue, is, as of the good things that appertaine vnto them, &amp; therefore it may well bee colde and drowſie, but not die. As alſo the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18666:53"/>that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his brethren had were ſuch, as although they had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not when they ſlept, yet when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked they returned againe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that by the death of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they were (as it were) interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet the benefite and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort abode by them ſtill. Following this that is aboue ſaid, we ſay boldlie, that what feelings, what illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or apprehenſions ſo euer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate haue: ſo it is that they neuer feele the holie ghoſt in them, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teſtimonie that they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. For according to this teſtimonie, they ſhould be, and ſhould abide the children of God: ſeeing the holie ghoſt can neither deceiue nor lie. As alſo after that God hath made vs once feele by the teſtimonie of his holie ſpirit that wee are his children, wee are certaine that wee cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that wee are indeed, and ſhall continue the children of God. For it is the teſtimonie and reuelation of the ſpirit of trueth. Alſo he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth faith,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.6.</note> doth not change: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:18666:54"/>his gifts are without repentance.<note place="margin">Ro. 11.29.</note> The ſecond difference may bee taken from this word,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.4.</note> taſt, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vſeth: To wete, that the reprobate are like to him who hauing taſted a good peece of wine, making ſhewe as if he would buy it, vnderſtanding the price, &amp; not willing to giue ſo much, leaueth it there, without buying or drinking of it any more. So the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate hauing taſted the heauenlie good things, finding them good, and praiſing them exceedingly, after they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the price, that is, that they muſt renounce themſelues, and beare the croſſe of Chriſt, to goe to take poſſeſsion of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which he hath purchaſed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his precious bloud. They will none of it at this price, &amp; ſo renounce theſe good things without drinking or imoying them. But the children of God on the other ſide, hauing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little a taſte of theſe heauenlie treaſures, deſire in ſuch ſort to haue the enioying of them, that they make reſolution to forſake all, to inioye it.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18666:54"/>We will adde this third reaſon: That as thoſe that haue their ſtomackes charged with euill humours, ceaſe not to eate ſometimes for all that, yea and to find taſt in ſome good meates, but are conſtrained after (through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill diſpoſition of their ſtomacke) to caſt it vp againe &amp; to vomit: So ſome reprobates hauing within them an euill conſcience, may well taſte the good heauenlie gifts, but this euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not being able to agree with the true &amp; ſure faith of the hart, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, that theſe gifts take no root to fructifie to ſaluation, ſo that finallie they caſt it off, or let it wither &amp; come to nothing. And this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thoſe before, are the principall cauſes, for the which many, that ſeemed to bee the children of God, do reuolt, as we will ſhew hereafter more at large. On the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, thoſe who haue faith, are aſſured, that though the graces of the holy ghoſt are ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weak in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; like fire couered with aſhes, &amp; trees in the winter, yet it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer come to nought or die: rather they recouer ſtrength
<pb facs="tcp:18666:55"/>at the laſt, whereby they are certaine to be, and to continue the children of GOD, and heires of euerlaſting life. Furthermore, let vs remember that theſe foule and groſſe faults of <hi>Dauid</hi> and of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; of others are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, firſt that they ſhould bee to vs as a mirrour of the fragilitie of man, to acknowledge, that if we be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is by the grace of our God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, that wee ſhould ſo much the more ſtand vppon our garde. As if in walking thou ſhouldeſt ſee him fall that goeth before thee, thou goeſt not to fall with him, but thou art to be ſo much the more circumſpect that thou fall not, as he did. Thirdlie, that vnderſtanding that faith abideth in them (although very weake &amp; feeble) thou maieſt take courage, beleeuing certainlie that faith which was once giuen thee, cannot bee quenched nor die. And therefore continue in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that thou art the child of God, raiſing vp thy ſelfe by their example, and reſoluing with thy ſelfe to walke conſtantlie as the child of God in true

In like maner the holines of God may better be knowne in the reuolt of hypocrites approching vnto him, &amp; ſo he may be the more glo rified of the people in ſuch iudgements.

So farre off is it then, that we ſhould be troubled for ſuch reuolts, that on the contrary, ſeeing that they are the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geances of GOD, wee ought ſo much the more to feare, and to continue the more conſtantly &amp; holily in the church of GOD.<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> And indeede if wee did at this day ſee <hi>Dauid</hi> execute that prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation which hee did make of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his houſe from vicious and wicked perſons, would we (thinke you) depart from it, doubting of the holineſſe of it? Shall we not rather be confirmed to
<pb facs="tcp:18666:59"/>tarrie there ſtil, deſiring to liue holilie? But more, what damage receiueth the Church in ſuch reuolts? The glorie of it before God conſiſteth not properlie in the greatneſſe of the number, but in the holineſſe of them. The health of a man conſiſtethnot in the abundance of humors, which will cauſe ſome deadlie diſeaſe at the laſt: for euen they that areladen with them, take medicines to purge them, that they might bee the more whole.<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.22</note> This is it which God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpoken of his Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that her ſiluer was turned into droſſe, &amp; her wine mingled with water, added for a great benefit, that he would take cleane away al her ſcomme, and remoue al her lead from her: and that hauing reſtored the Iudges and Counſellers, ſo as they had bene at the beginning, it ſhoulde be called the righteous and faithful Citie. Experience ſheweth, that in the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie &amp; peace of the church many thruſt in themſelues, ſul of auarice, ambition, pride, and of other corruptions and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; to be ſhort it hapneth euen as in a ſweet &amp; rainie ſeaſon, that many weeds

Let vs further conſider the cauſes of reuoltes. If this hapned then when the Church was in peace &amp; proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, it ſhold ſeeme there were more occaſion to call into dout our doctrine: But it is in the time of perſecution, that theſe reuolts are ſeen; &amp; ſo, it is feare to leeſe their goods, their dignities, their parents, their country, their liues, that cauſeth them to reuolt. It is then the fleſh, it is the world, it is the miſtruſt of God, and not the allowing of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall doctrine, that maketh them to change their religion.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.10</note> As alſo S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that

<pb facs="tcp:18666:60"/>danger, although he might yet haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed his miniſterie, he began to ſeeke the meanes as a hireling, to forſake his flocke. He knoweth what letters I writ vnto him, reprouing his ſlothfulnes, his crafts and euill conſcience in the reaſons which he put forth, to haue ſome colour to withdraw himſelf. He knoweth alſo what reproofes he had receyued by the letters of others, that he ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file his miniſterie in intermedling ſo erneſtly in the matters of war &amp; of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie. After the Towne of <hi>Bruges</hi> was re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred to the enemy, he withdrew him ſelfinto <hi>Zeland</hi> &amp; <hi>Holand.</hi> Where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that hee began (as good reaſon was) for many conſiderations to bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in our churches, and in no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he gote him out of the countrie. So feeling in his conſcience ſmall appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be eſtabliſhed in his Miniſtery againe, hauing no hope of preferment in any other vocation, and being purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the iuſt iudgement of God falling vpon euil conſciences; he reuolted, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king happilie that hee ſhould receiue ſome recompence for the offence that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18666:60"/>he had offered againſt the holie Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, and at the leaſt to enter againe into the poſſeſsion of his goods. This then is not the chaunging of doctrine, which mooued him, but (as wee haue ſaide) it is the fleſh, and the world: it is enuie that maketh the Monke. It is ambition the mother of hereſie, as ſaint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth: It is an euill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the rocke that maketh the ſhippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of Faith, as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.19</note> which hath made him to chaunge his profeſsion. To be ſhort, GOD could no longer ſuffer ſuch an hypocrite in his church, nor ſuch a filth in his holie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: hee woulde bee ſanctified in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vengeance vpon him, who ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately approched vnto him. Hee hath ſet him foorth for an example of his iudgements, that thoſe that make profeſsion of Religion, and chieflie the Miniſters of the worde, may ſtudy more and more to walke with a good conſcience to keepe themſelues in their vocation, to renounce the paſsions of the fleſh, &amp; the illuſions of the world, and ſo with feruent praiers to continue
<pb facs="tcp:18666:61"/>conſtantly in the grace of the Lorde. Furthermore, let him make as manie ſhewes as he wil, let him ſweare, let him lift vp his hands, and his eies to heauen, let him weare a great paire of beads, let him goe oft and deuoutlie to the maſſe; yet ſhall hee not eaſily make the Ieſuites (who are cunninger than he) to beleue, that hee dooth it indeede and from his heart. For thoſe who among them haue any little more wit than the common ſort, vnderſtand well enough if they wold confeſſe it, that the change of the holy Supper into the Maſſe, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of bread in it, the fiery purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory after death, the opinion of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paradiſe by workes, ſpecially thoſe of ſupererogation; the ſetting foorth of God the father, who is an inuiſible and eternal ſpirit, vnder the figure of an old man: the worſhipping of images, the inuocation of Saints departed, candles lighted at noone dayes, &amp; borne in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, the great beads hanging at their neckes, and other ſuch idolatries &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, are either ſo abhominable or ſo manifeſtly contrary to the word of

The intention neither of Chriſt nor of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was to ſet before them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of miſerable perſons, as it is ſaide, to haue companions in their miſeries, but rather to ſhew them, that the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they indured were proper to the ſeruants and children of GOD, and that therefore they ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelues, beeing honoured with the liuerie of their other brethren and members of Chriſt, yea, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſeruaunts of God, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28</note> And indeede ſeeing thoſe whom God had foreknowne, thoſe hee hath predeſtinate to be faſhioned like vnto the Image of Chriſt.

Shall wee doubt then of our adoption, beeing called vnto the ſame condition which the welbeloued Sonne of GOD tooke vpon him going to the inioying of his glorie?

               </note> The goodneſſe of God (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) is angrie with his children in this world, that hee may not bee angrie with them in the life to come: and by his mercie he vſeth ſome temporal ſeueritie, to exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from euerlaſting vengeance.

Medicines are giuen either to heale diſeaſes, or to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore are verie requiſite for the health and life of man. Nowe what bee theſe afflictions, but medicines of our ſoules? as alſo S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, This which thou ſo lamenteſt, is thy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and not thy puniſhment, As in a houſe where there are manie children, the rod is neceſſarie: &amp; as in a Citie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to diuers diſeaſes, &amp; where there is an euill aire, Phiſitions are needfull: ſo in the houſe of god, where ther are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie children inclined to euill, the rod is many times more neceſſarie than bread: and in ſuch an hoſpitall full of diſeaſes and ſores, as the Church is (for out of it they are dead) it is a great fault if there be not Phiſitions and Surgeons to heale the corruptions of our ſoules, &amp; to keep vs from offending God, &amp; from falling into death. Many accuſtomd to delicate

And indeede, behold the difference betweene a madd man, and one that is ſicke of a corporall diſeaſe; The mad man is angry with the Phiſition, chaſeth him away, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth awaye the medicine: but the other ſendeth for a Phiſition, taketh drinke at his hand, thanketh him, yea and giueth him a reward: So when God the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Phiſition of our ſoules, viſiteth vs and giueth vs wholſome medicines, let vs not be like mad men reiecting the hand of God, but receiuing the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, let vs giue him thankes and bleſſe him, after the example of <hi>Iob;</hi>

Experience ſheweth, that in bankets and feaſts men talke of the world: but where ſickneſſe, death and burials are, they talk of euerlaſting life. It is alſo ſeene that riches lift vs vp in pride and inſolencie, and that pouertie bringeth vs downe and humbleth vs: that in proſperity we triumph, and feele not the force of the ſpirituall inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and teachings: but being afflicted with ſickneſſe or anie other way, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are godly people, wee confeſſe that all fleſh is but graſſe, and that we haue here no abiding Citie. To be ſhort, our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities tending vnto death, make vs to lift vp our vnderſtanding and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a better life. Then God, who is good, and dooing well vnto men, who taketh not pleaſure in our euills, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs not, but to wake vs the better, &amp; to ſanctifie vs in his obedience, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our affections, and by the ſorrowes of troubles maketh vs to abhorre our corruptions, the verie cauſe of them. He
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18666:87"/>doth as the good keeper of a vine,<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> who cutteth his vine, that it may beare more and better fruite, not ſuffring it to grow wilde, in leauing too mame boughes on it. And as we cut the winges of hennes and other birdes, that they ſhould not flie away and be loſt: ſo God cutteth off from vs the commodities of the fleſh to keepe vs downe, that we lift not vp and deſtroy our ſelues with vain confidence &amp; pride. We ſee alſo that the corne ſhut within the chaffe commeth not foorth, if the eare be not beaten: and that it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth ſtil in the chaffe if it be not fanned.

When a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to weane her childe ſhal ſay vnto him night and day, My childe, it is time to weane thee, thou art growen great inough, and I am with childe, my milke is corrupt, it will make thee ſick; yet he is ſo fond of the breaſt that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if after the ſimilitude of a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who is able to make of the ſelfe ſame lumpe of earth, ſome veſſells of honor, and others of diſhonor, Saint
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18666:91"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth, that God hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to chuſe ſome to ſaluation,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.20.</note> and to reiect others, ſo as they that are reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be damned eternallie, haue no cauſe to replie or murmur: how much more ought wee to hold our peace &amp; obey, when he diſpoſeth that we ſhall be afflicted but for a little time, and that in the bodie onelie? But that in this obedience wee may feele indeed that we are happie,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe he is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</note> we muſt marke an other poynt: that he which doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vs, is not onelie our creatour, but alſo our redeemer: not only God, but alſo our GOD and father. And that ſame aſſureth vs, that according to the loue that he beareth vs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite wiſedome, hee will diſpoſe nothing of vs, which ſhall not be to his glorie, and to our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and ſaluation. It is well knowne that fathers &amp; mothers take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to afflict their children, and to make them to weepe. And although they haue power to beate them, to appoynt them their diet, and to put them abroad, either to ſchoole, or to
<pb facs="tcp:18666:92"/>ſerue ſome other, yet when they doo this, men doo not onlie confeſſe that they haue authoritie ſo to do: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo euerie one beleeueth, that it is for the benefite of the children, whoſe duetie alſo it is to like well of it, and to render vnto them willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now, properlie God onlie is our father,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.9.</note> as Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: Call ye no man father vppon the earth: ye haue but one father, which is in heauen. What iniurie then doo we to this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie true father, that we being afflicted by his hand, after what manner ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, doo not ſanctifie his name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our ſelues to his will, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confeſsing, that all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from his goodnes and loue, to his glorie, and our benefite and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

To be ſhort, to make vs ſo much the more feruently to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:18666:93"/>God; it reſteth that wee conclude, that indeede they proceed from the loue of God toward vs, &amp; of the care that he hath of our ſaluation, and ſo, that in afflicting vs, he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe indeed our father: as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> doth alſo teach vs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.6.</note> That God chaſtiſeth thoſe whom he loueth, and correcteth euery child whom he receiueth: If you indure (ſaith he) chaſtiſement, God offereth himſelfe vnto you, as vnto his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what child is it whom the father doth not chaſtiſe? Then, if ye be not vnder chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, yee are baſtards and not ſonnes. Rods then are teſtimonies, that he acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth vs his lawfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not baſtards. And nature it ſelfe teacheth it vs. For, if wee ſee two children ſtriue together, and a man comming by, taketh the one of them and beateth him, leauing the other, we will iudge by and by that this man is the father of him that he did beate, and that the other appertained not vnto him. And this is it that S. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:18666:93"/>meaneth, ſaying: that iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at the houſe of God:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.17.</note> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are his children and houſehold ſeruants, which are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this life. The which thing a good auncient father did thinke and well expreſſe, calling his afflictions,<note place="margin">Grego. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian.</note> bitter arrowes ſhot from a ſweet and amiable hand. Therefore as, when we ſee the Carpenters ſtrike with their hatchets vpon pieces of wood to pare it, or plane it: and Maſons to poliſh ſtones with the ſtrokes of an ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; wee gather that theſe are ſtones and timber, which the maſter would imploy to ſome building: Euen ſo let vs conclude of our ſelues, that if God lift vp vpon vs the hatchets and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of afflictions to poliſh vs: It is a manifeſt and ſure teſtimonie, that he hath choſen vs to put in the building of his temple. And that ſo, we are his children both welbeloued and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie. But let vs paſſe to another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſingular comfort.</p>

But yet in this weakenes of faith, doo not we knowe, that the wicked in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance are poore, and wee in our pouertie are rich.

The Maſter of a houſe, who keepeth his inheritance for his Sonne, doth not thinke that he doth any thing for him, to clothe him with the liuerie of his ſeruants: as alſo when any one ſhall be receiued for a

The ſame Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Hebrevves</hi> that beleeued, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very well, that they alſo did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this reward. For he beareth them witneſſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.34</note> that they had taken ioyfullie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18666:99"/>the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing, that they had a better riches inheauen, which abideth for euer. Wherein alſo he confirmeth them, adding this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: Then caſt not off your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which hath great reward.<note place="margin">The fruite in the life to come incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible: firſt, for the greatneſſe. Rom. 8.18</note> Now although, as touching our ſelues, we can not comprehend what this reward ſhall be, yet ought we certainly to beleeue it, that it is moſt certaine, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt hath promiſed it; and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: ſeeing that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the ſuffrings of this preſent life are not woorthie of the glorie to come, which ſhall be reuealed in vs. As alſo he ſayth in an other place:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.17</note> That our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie afflictions which indure but a ſmall time, and are gone in a moment, ſhal bring forth in vs an eternal waight of glorie maruelous excellent. And to giue ſome taſte in waighting for the ful reuelation, and inioying of it, let vs note in this laſt ſentence of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> the compariſon that hee maketh of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that are ſwift, and paſsing in a moment, and the eternall waight of glorie maruellous excellent, which
<pb facs="tcp:18666:100"/>they bring foorth. For true it is, that our outward man decayeth, as hee ſaid, meaning thereby the loſſe of health, of riches, honours, friendſhips, aliances, and other ſuch aides and commodities of this life, and the life it ſelfe: but in the meane time the inward man is renued euery day, by an happy and excellent chaunge, in goods and honours that are ſpirituall, heauenly, and eternall. And indeede what is all that which we ſuffer and loſe here for Ieſus Chriſt, in reſpect of the infinite and incomprehenſible good things, which we ſhall recouer in heauen, whereof alſo we haue a feeling in this preſent life? Are we conſtrained to forſake a fleſhlie father?

A she knoweth that we are too much tied to goods, dignities, and other commodities of the fleſh, that in ſtede of willingly laying vp our treſure in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we lay it vp in earth: he ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that we ſhalbe perſecuted for his name, &amp; doth therin, as a good &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tutor, who takyng the mony of his pupill, putteth it out to profit, or buieth for him good rents with it.

And firſt let vs ſay boldly, that our troubles are ſhort, becauſe our daies are ſhort; &amp; that the glorie is of long continuaunce, becauſe there ſhall be no ende of it. But for the better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our afflictions, we muſt conſider according to the inſtruction of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Co. 4.18.</note> the things inuiſible, that are eternal. For in reſpect of them, wee ſhall finde, that the viſible things which concerne this life, are temporall, that is to ſay, during a little time. The Patriarch
<hi>Iacob</hi> being demaunded of <hi>Pharao</hi> of his age, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:102"/>that the yeres of his pilgrimage had been few and euill.<note place="margin">Gen.
47.9.</note> And how were they few, ſeeing he had liued 130. yeres? ſurely in compariſon or
8. or 900. yeres which his forefathers had liued, as alſo he addeth, that his yeres had not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the yeres of his fathers. How then are not our daies ſhort, not comming at the moſt but to 70. or 80. yeres, &amp; that in thoſe that haue the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt or migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt bodies,<note place="margin">Pſa. 90.10.</note> as the ſong of Moſes impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. God ſpeaking of the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued 70. yeres, ſaith thus:<note place="margin">Eſai. 54.8.</note> I haue for a little while as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mine indignation hid my face from thee. How? 70. yeares, are they a little time, is that but a moment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation? yea, in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and euerlaſting happineſſe, which he would communicate to his people: as he addeth, That he would haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them with euerlaſting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. This alſo is the cauſe why S. <hi>John</hi> calleth the time folowing Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.18</note> the laſt houre: as if he wold diuide the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the world into 3. or 4. hours, wherof the laſt ſhuld be after this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Ieſus Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18666:102"/>the end of the world: ſo this laſt hour ſhould now haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued 1587. yeres, and theſe 1587. yeres ſhould not be yet a whole houre finiſhed. This ſeemeth ſtrange to vs. But let vs ſet before vs 2. eternities of times: that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world, &amp; that is an infinite time (if a man may cal that time) and a ſwalowing vp of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man: and the eternitie of time which ſhal be after the ende of the world, and behold againe an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heuſible infinitenes of time. Now let vs conſider the continuance of the world betweene theſe two eternities. When it ſhall continue
7.8. or 9000. yeares, this ſhould not be, in reſpect of theſe 2. eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, 2. or 3. houres no not one houre: it ſhould bee yet leſſe than one graine in reſpect of all the ſand in the world: for, as touching the ſand the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is finite, but in eternitie there is no end. And here vnto tendeth that which S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.8.</note> That before God, 1000. yeres are but as one day, and a day as 1000. yeres, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as before the eternitie of GOD, there is no numbring of time; for there is no time at all. According vnto this,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:103"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.4.</note> that 1000. yeres before god are as a day that is paſt. If then 1000. yeres are but as a day paſt, or an houre,
60. or 80. yeres are but as one minute of time: ſo the longeſt continuance of our afflictions ſhould be but one minute; &amp; yet there are ſome that accompliſh not that. And when doo we begin this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of tribulations? ſeeing that a great part of our life paſſeth before we ſuffer anie thing for the name of Chriſt; &amp; yet there is ſome intermiſſion in them, if it were but in ſleeping. Then, we doo now ſee how true it is, that S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that our afflictions paſſe in a moment. And what is that which this moment of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions bringeth vs? An eternal waight (ſaith he) of glorie, as wee haue largely ſhewed here before.<note place="margin">In the firſt chapter.</note> And in deede there ſhall be no ende ſaith the Angell, of the kingdome of Chriſt. And wee are the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.33.</note> ouer whom he ſhal raign for euermore.<note place="margin">1. The

If God for the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18666:103"/>full meaſure of our felicitie ſhalbe all in al, when we haue him in vs,<note place="margin">1. Co. 13.25</note> who is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immortal, we ſhall enioy a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious immortalitie: as alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. That hee hath brought to light, life and immortalitie by the goſpel. To be ſhort, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hauing ſet forth vnto vs the laſt iudgement, ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.46.</note> That the ſheepe that ſhall bee at the right hand of Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall goe into euerlaſting life. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, when he promiſeth vs a perfect ioy, headdeth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.22.</note> that it ſhal neuer be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from vs. Now, what compariſon is there betweene one moment of affliction, &amp; a glorie, a life, and a ioy, that ſhal laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternallie and without end? Then when we thinke that our croſſe is long &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to beare, let vs ſet before vs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and the eternitie of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible glorie, wherunto we aſcend by it, whereof alſo wee feele the earneſt pennie &amp; beginnings in our hearts, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the full feeling, and thorow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of this felicitie, when we ſhall be lifed vp, and put in poſſeſsion of the kingdome of heauen. Now this reward is certaine and aſſured to al thoſe which
<pb facs="tcp:18666:104"/>ſhall ſuffer for the name of Ieſus Chriſt. Such afflictions then are ſeales of the loue of God towards vs, &amp; teſtimonies that he taketh vs into the number of his beſt beloued children, and that he will make vs indeed &amp; euerlaſtingly happie.</p>

Then when we ſee it ſo mightelie aſſailed, by the potentates of this worlde, conſpiring her ruine, by ſo many forces and ſlights, and by ſo many heretiks, doth not God in the guiding, deliuering and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it, ſhewe that it is hee himſelfe, and he alone, which maintaineth and defendeth it?

When Saint

<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was quite diſperſed: but by the faithfull diſperſed, there were as many more newe Churches ſet vp. And it is as if GOD tooke, at the handes of his enemies, corne into his Garner to ſowe, whereof ſhould follow a goodlie and plentifull harueſt. It is a fruit that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> noteth in his afflictions,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.12</note> ſaying, Brethren, I woulde haue you to vnderſtand, that the things which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to mee, came to the aduauncement of the Goſpell: ſo as my bandes were made famous in Chriſt, through all the Iudgement hall, and in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And many of the brethren (made bolde by my bandes) durſt ſpeake of the worde more freely. <hi>Iustine</hi> in his communication with
<hi>Triphon</hi> writeth that the ſame thing hapned in his time. It may appeare (ſayth hee) euery day,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:108"/>that wee which beleeue in Chriſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſtoniſhed nor daunted of any, if they cut off our heades, if they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs, if they caſt vs vnto wilde beaſts, or into fires, or vnto any other torment; the more they torment vs, ſo much the more increaſeth the number of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, neyther more nor leſſe, than as men cut their Vines, to make them the more fruitfull. So the Diuell is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beguiled. For in perſecuting thoſe which profeſſe the Goſpell, hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to ſtoppe men from beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt, to be ſaued. But it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out quite contrarie. For the poore ignoraunt men ſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of the Martyres: gather twoo pointes, firſt, that there is no hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in them, nor any fleſhlie paſsion which maketh them to followe this doctrine, which to maintaine they vtterly abandon all the commodities of the fleſh, the honours of the world, and life it ſelfe. Next, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thinke, that the doctrine for which they ſuffer, is of GOD, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is by no humane, but by very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18666:108"/>power, that they ſuffer conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly ſo many reproches, diſcommodities and cruelties. And ſo is this Sentence ſo famous verified: That the blood of the Martyres is the ſeede of the Church. In like manner thoſe that haue alreadie the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the doctrine, are confirmed as wel to perſeuere in it, as to take corage and ſtrength to ſuffer in like manner for the maintenance of it. For, ſeeing that GOD forſaketh not his ſeruants in the conflict, but is with them, and in them, making them victorious: we take thereof aſſuraunce, that GOD will alſo ouercome in vs all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, threatnings and torments: And beholding them, thorough death to enter into life, and by the Croſſe to aſcend into the Kingdome of Heauen, wee feele our ſelues inflamed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be their companions both in the troubles, and in the triumph of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The which thing maketh vs to perſeuere conſtantly in the trueth of the doctrine, which ſetteth (as it were) before our eyes this ſoueraigne felicitie,
<pb facs="tcp:18666:109"/>euen the heauens open, and Ieſus Chriſt ſtretching out his hand, to drawe vs vp into the fellowſhippe of his ioye, and glorie incomprehenſible and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
            <p>The people of the world cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe ſo excellent fruites of the afflictions for the name of Chriſt, which we haue ſet downe heere aboue, being therein like to the Philiſtins the companions of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which coulde not comprehend this propoſition that hee made them; Out of the eater came meate,<note place="margin">Iudg. 14.14</note> and out of the fierce came ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: But wee, that are taught in the Schoole of Chriſt by his Spirite, wee vnderſtand and beleeue that as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hauing vanquiſhed the Lion, found in the bodie of it honnie, ſo we hauing conſtantly ouercome all the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles of this life, which are like vnto fierce and cruell Lions, readie to deuoure vs, wee ſhall finde this hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſo excellent of the fruites of the croſſe of Chriſt, which ſhall make vs bleſſed for euermore. Seeing then, that the perſecutions and afflictions that we

Alas Lord, wee yeelde our ſelues guilty before thee, confeſsing that we are inexcuſable, and vnworthie to be named thy children: yea, wee are worthie to bee reiected of thee, wee are worthie of hel, &amp; to be creatures accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for euer. For (ô our good God) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were the children of wrath, thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned to all euil, thou hadſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18666:127"/>pitie vppon vs poore and abhominable ſinners. Thou haſt caſt the eyes of thy fauour vppon vs. Thou haſt giuen thy welbeloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt to the ſhameful and curſed death of the croſſe for vs. Thou haſt giuen vs thy holy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, that bleſſed and ioyfull tidings of our ſaluation: Thou haſt accompanied it with thy ſpirit to lighten vs, to draw vs vnto thee, to make vs partakers of the treaſures of thy Kingdome &amp; of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Thou haſt ſtretched out thy hand from heauen to the depth of hell, to pul vs backe, and to make vs thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie children. Thou haſt done according to the good pleaſure of thy will, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thou ſheweſt mercie on whom thou wilt ſhewe mercie. Alas Lord, ought not we to acknowledge the daye of thy viſitation, and the time of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Ought not we to feele the abundant riches of thy incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, to loue, ſerue, praiſe, and adore thee? to renounce our ſelues, the world and the fleſh, and all that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to thy glorie: yea to abhorre all that doth diſpleaſe thee? to walke as

But alas, ô Lord our God, we (quite contrarie) hauing brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Church the world and the fleſh, haue kept in our ſelues theſe enemies of thy glory, theſe plagues of our ſoules, &amp; haue ſerued them. Our infidelitie &amp; our fleſh haue made vs loue the earth more than the heauen, the world more than thy kingdome, the filthines and duſt of vaine riches, more than the treaſures of heauenlie and eternall good things, the ſmoke of humane honors, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glorious eſtate to be thy childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes the roote of all euill, hath harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our harts to deſpiſe thy poore ones, euen Ieſus Chriſt in his members. Wee haue ſlaundered thy holy Goſpell by fraudes, deceipts, &amp; robbings: occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our traffique and doing our affaires, as people hauing no knowledge of thee.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18666:128"/>The aire in the Cities where thy word hath bin preached, hath bin ſtinking &amp; infected, with the whoredomes, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and other infamous acts that there haue bin committed. Gluttonie &amp; dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes haue made brutiſh thoſe, that for thy bleſsings and bountie ought to haue praiſed thee. Euerie man thinking onlie how to profit &amp; aduance himſelf in this world, to the deſpiſing of thy holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, &amp; the building of thy Church. The profeſsion of thy holy religion hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many, but for the cloke of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. Wee haue put out truſt in the arme of fleſh, &amp; in broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reeds, ſeeking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort for thy Church of the enemies of it, in forſaking the fountaine of liuing waters, and the almightie. Crimes, treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, blaſphemies and iniquities haue bin winked at &amp; ſupported, in defiling the ſeate of thy iuſtice, without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: thy threatnings &amp; promiſes reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as vanities, the holy Miniſterie of thy Word deſpiſed, the chaſtiſements which thou haſt exerciſed on our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren neglected, without thinking what our ſelues haue deſerued. Wee haue not felt ſorow for the afflictions of thy
<pb facs="tcp:18666:129"/>children, to mourne with them, and to feare thy iudgements. And what ſhal we ſay more, ô Lord? Our iniquities are as mountaines, our ingratitude and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, as the great deepe, our whole life, before thee, being nothing elſe but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſinne and deſpiſing of thy holy Maieſtie. If they who neuer heard ſpeak of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and that haue not knowen thy will, are iuſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy wrath; what iudgement, what condemnation, what hells and curſſes haue we deſerued, hauing ſo villainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo long, ſo obſtinately, deſpiſed thy holy inſtructions, thy promiſes, thy threatenings, and the examples of thy iudgements, which thou haſt exerciſed before our eyes. Alſo the voyce of our ingratitude is aſcended before thee: our iniquities haue, and doo crie vengeance againſt vs. Theſe are the procurers and aduocates of thy iuſtice, ſoliciting theſe iudgements againſt vs. Our ſinnes haue ſtrengthned our enemies, &amp; haue made them conquerours ouer vs. We haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen iniquitie, and we haue reaped affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: as thou ſeeſt, ô Lord our God,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18666:129"/>that thy children are baniſhed, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and impouriſhed, that they are cruellie dealt withall, trodden vnder foote, and expoſed to the laughter of thine enemies. Our perſecuters make a ſcorne of thoſe, ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy name is called on, &amp; they make their boaſt of the euill that they doo: They ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy flockes: They throwe downe the ſcepter of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: They depriue thy children of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of thy word. Thoſe temples (O Lord) thoſe temples where not long ſince, thy praiſes did ſound, in which thy holie Goſpell was preached, the Sacraments purelie miniſtred, thy name religiouſlie called on: Theſe temples, O Lord, are now defiled with Idols and idolatrie, the abominable Maſſe is eſtabliſhed againe, falſe tales and lies are preached. Theſe temples where thy people aſſembled in ſo great number to praiſe thee, and to behold thy louing countenance, are now filled with people blaſpheming thy holie name, and treading vnder their feete the bloud and glorie of thy
<pb facs="tcp:18666:130"/>ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. This youth of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, fondlings, and others that went to ſchoole, being brought vp in the knowledge of thee, &amp; nouriſhed in thy feare, is now giuen vp to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of thy trueth, to be inſtructed in the damnable doctrine and ſeruice of Antichriſt. O good God, our ſunne is turned into darknes, the Moone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud, our health into ſicknes, our life into death: And yet, if thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt puniſh vs yet more rigorouſlie, than hetherto thou haſt done, &amp; that for one ſtripe wee ſhould receiue an hundred. If thou ſhouldeſt tranſport the kingdome of thy ſonne from vs, to the Turkes, and the Iewes: If thou ſhouldeſt ſend ſuch a famine of thy word, as running through the forreſts to haue ſome refreſhing, and finding none, our ſoules ſhould faint: Yea Lord, if thou ſhouldeſt throw vs down into hell: we confeſſe that it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie right, and yeeld our ſelues guiltie, acknowledging that we haue well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it. Notwithſtanding, O good God and father, there is mercie with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18666:130"/>thee, yea thy mercies are infinite to ſwallowe vp the multitude and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſnes of our ſinnes. Thou art a God gracious &amp; pitifull, ſlowe vnto wrath, abounding in mercie and trueth, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping mercie for thouſands, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning iniquitie, tranſgreſsion &amp; ſinne. Thou haſt ſaid that thou wilt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that hee turne and liue. Conuert vs then, O Lord, that we may be conuerted, and that we may liue before thee. We are poore ſinners, we confeſſe it: but yet thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners. Behold vs then, O Lord, not in our ſelues (for wee are vnworthy of thy grace) but behold vs in the face of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and for his ſake, bee at tone with vs, and be mercifull and fauourable vnto vs: that in the multitude of our ſinnes the greatnes of thy grace may ſhine: if thou regard our iniquities, who is he that is able to ſtand before thee? Wee haue been vnfaithfull, but thou remaineſt ſtill faithfull. Thou canſt not renounce thy mercie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb facs="tcp:18666:131"/>we haueforſaken thee, but thou haſt promiſed not to forſake vs. Wee haue forgotten thee, but thou haſt ſaid, that though a mother ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her childe, yet wouldſt not thou forget vs. Thou haſt made a couenant with vs, wherein thou haſt promiſed to pardon our ſinnes, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our iniquities no more. Thou haſt promiſed, that though our ſins were as red as ſcarlet, thou wouldeſt make them as white as wooll: if they were as red as crimſon, that they ſhould be made as white as ſnowe. We are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie laden, and labour with our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. But Ieſus Chriſt hath called vs to him, and hath promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh vs. Haue pitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on vs, O Lord, haue pitie vpon vs. Let our miſeries moue the bowells of thy mercie. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs (O our GOD) forgiue vs for thine owne ſake, for the glorie of thy name, and for thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake: Impute vnto vs the goodnes that is in him, that the euill that is in vs may not be imputed. Thou haſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſhed the iuſt, that thou mighteſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18666:131"/>pardon the wicked: Accept thou the merites of his death and paſsion, for ſatiſſaction of all that is in vs, worthie of thy wrath and indignation: and make vs to feele the fruites of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with thee. If thou wilt afflict our bodies, haue yet pitie of our ſoules. If thou wilt impouriſh vs on the earth, depriue vs not yet of the riches of heauen. If thou wilt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the bread of our bodies, yet leaue vs the ſpirituall bread of our ſoules. Though wee bee in reproach among our enemies, yet let not thy name be blaſphemed. Though we bee accurſed of the world, yet let vs bee bleſſed of thee. Though the world hate vs, yet let thy loue abide vpon vs. O Lord we are thine, forſake vs not. Thou haſt ſaide, I am the Eternall, this is my name, I will not giue my glorie vnto Images, nor my praiſe vnto another. For thine owne ſake then, euen for thine owne ſake haue mercie vpon vs. For why ſhall thy name bee blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for our ſakes? Not vnto vs Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue
<pb facs="tcp:18666:132"/>glorie and honour, in ſhewing foorth the riches of thy graces, of thy truth, and of thy might. Thou art the God of glorie, ſanctifie thy name, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light out of our darknes, and lift out of death, making perfect thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in our infirmitie, and thy great grace in our vnworthines, to thy praiſe and glorie. Heare the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thine enemies, boaſting them ſelues in their counſels and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, triumphing and reioycing in our confuſion: as if we were not thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thy children, thy Church: as if wee were caſt off of thee: as if thou were not able to helpe or keepe vs. Neuertheleſſe, thou art our creatour, and wee are the worke of thy hands: Thou art our ſhepheard, wee are thy flocke: Thou art our father, wee are thy children: Thou art our God, wee are thine inheritance: Thou art our redeemer, wee are the people whome thou haſt bought. It is thou alſo (O our God) who by thy word alone, haſt created the heauen and the earth, the ſea and al that is in them: it is by thee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18666:132"/>that all things liue, be, and haue their mouing: it is of thee, by thee and for thee, that all things are. It is thou which dooeſt whatſoeuer thou wilt. And there is neither counſell, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor ſtrength againſt thee. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe then, O Lord, the rage and furie of thine enemies, breake their forces, diſsipate their counſels, confound them in the bold enterpriſes which they haue taken in hand againſt thee, and thy ſonne leſus Chriſt. Maintaine the reſt of thy flocke, which thou haſt kept vntill this day. Eſtabliſh againe the Churches that are ruined and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed. Suffer not the memorie of thy name to be aboliſhed from the earth: rather let thy word ſound, and thy Goſpell bee preached, where it hath not yet been heard, to gather thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect vnto thee, and to magnifie thy name: And that ſo wee may ſee it flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh more &amp; more, and the kingdome of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord to bee aduanced for euer more. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <l>in pleaſure, wealth, and pride:</l>
            <l>Religion then will take her flight,</l>
            <l>ſhe may not there abide.</l>
            <l>Where by our ſoules in wofull plight</l>
            <l>continually remaine:</l>
            <l>Yet haue not we the grace or might</l>
            <l>from ſuch luſts to refraine.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18666:135"/>In which estate mest willingly</l>
            <l>(though tending right to hell)</l>
            <l>We compt our chiefe felicitie,</l>
            <l>and loue therein to dwell.</l>
            <l>Therefore the Lord which is aboue,</l>
            <l>regarding vs below</l>
            <l>With mercie, pitie, grace and loue,</l>
            <l>that alwases from him flow,</l>
            <l>Doth mix with griefe theſe earthly things</l>
            <l>wherein we doo delight:</l>
            <l>Which to our ſoules all ſorow brings,</l>
            <l>or elſe remoou'th them quite.</l>
            <l>Then dooth the holie word of God</l>

            <l>The world which earſt moſt pleaſant was</l>
            <l>now loathſome ſeem'th to be:</l>
            <l>It doth appeare (as in a glaſſe)</l>
            <l>all fraught with miſerie.</l>
            <l>Then feare we hell, then flie we ſinne,</l>
            <l>then ſeeke we heauen the more:</l>
            <l>To vſe good meanes we then begin,</l>
            <l>which we deſpiſde before.</l>
            <l>Then can we pray, then can we call</l>
            <l>to God for ſtrength and grace:</l>
            <l>

            <l>Then heare we with attentiuenes,</l>
            <l>then read we with all care:</l>
            <l>Then pray we with great feruentnes,</l>
            <l>no trauaile then we ſpare.</l>
            <l>Then ſhall we ſee, feele and confeſſe</l>
            <l>the ſtate wherein we dwelt,</l>
            <l>To be nothing but wretchednes:</l>
